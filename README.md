# Wine-Quality

This Dataset is about wine quality, giving some features of the wine to determine the quality of the wine.
So In this project I build a predictive system to predict the quality of the wine, if it's " good " or " bad ", And I used Random Forest Classifier Algorithm for this data to build the predictive system and I was able to fint the most perfect number of estimators for the algorithm
